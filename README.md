#Washing Machine Controller with Mode Design

1. A washing machine system comprising: an outer tub; a cylindrical basket rotatably supported within the outer tub, the basket adapted to receive launderable items and wash water during a wash operation.

2. The washing machine system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further adapted to instruct the drive motor to rotate the basket at only non-zero rotational accelerations when the rotational speed of the basket is between the maximum resonance speed and the minimum resonance speed.

3. The washing machine system of claim 2, wherein the controller is further adapted to instruct the drive motor to successively accelerate the rotational speed of the basket to a speed above the minimum resonance speed and to decelerate the basket to a speed below the maximum resonance speed.

4. The washing machine system of claim 4, wherein the controller instructs the drive motor to maintain a non-zero rotational acceleration of the basket during the first, second, and third positive acceleration periods and the first and second negative acceleration periods.


5. The washing machine system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further adapted to determine an imbalanced-load parameter based on the amount of power used by the drive motor to rotate the basket at the selective rotational speeds
